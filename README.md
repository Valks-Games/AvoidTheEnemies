This is a learning project to understand how games like Vampire Survivors and Halls of Torment were made.

## Roadmap v0.1
- [x] XP Progress Bar
- [x] Basic Card UI
- [x] Enemies collide nicely with each other
- [x] Difficulty increases over time
- [x] Pause game on level up / resume game on picking card
- [ ] Get cards working. Player gets Movement speed, attack speed, projectile count, projectile pierce, projectile damage, health, etc
- [ ] XP Orbs animate towards player when player is near them
- [ ] Procedural tile background art (minimal collidables as enemies will not have pathfinding)
- [ ] Show POIs off screen with edge screen indicators

## Roadmap v1.0
(Won't get around to doing this for a very very long time)
- [ ] Different types of bosses
- [ ] Basic sounds and music
