This game is using the [latest Godot 4 C# release](https://godotengine.org/)

## Roadmap v0.1
- XP Orbs animate towards player when player is near them
- XP Progress Bar
- Procedural tile background art (minimal collidables as enemies will not have pathfinding)
- Get cards working. Movement speed, attack speed, projectile count, projectile pierce, projectile damage, health, and more I can't think off hand right now
- Show POIs off screen with edge screen indicators
- Basic sounds and music
- And probably more..

## Roadmap v1.0
(Won't get around to doing this for a very very long time)
- Different types of bosses
- Look into multiplayer

## Contributing
Currently looking for programmers to peer review my code.
